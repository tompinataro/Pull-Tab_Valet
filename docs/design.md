# Design (Figma)

## Canonical link

**Figma:** https://www.figma.com/design/Lr1ZQiI9lmSIgZOLOlPQKN/PTV-Wireframes?m=auto&t=9JKg2VFl36kYi8pT-1

If specific pages/frames should be prioritized for export/review, add deep-links here.

## How to review

- Use Figma comments to tag questions/edge-cases.
- When you comment on a screen, note whether it impacts:
  - Audit log requirements
  - Offline sync behaviors
  - Error states / empty states

## Design assumptions (initial)

These assumptions should be confirmed/updated once the Figma file is linked:

- The UI exposes an **audit/history view** (or at least makes audit entries accessible).
- The UI supports an **offline/poor connectivity state** (banner, icon, or status).
- Edits made offline are queued and synced later.
